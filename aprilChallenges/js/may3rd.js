// Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

// I love you
// a little
// a lot
// passionately
// madly
// not at all

// When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

// Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say for a flower of a given number of petals, where nb_petals > 0.

// function flower(petals) {
//     const phrase = ['I love you', 'A little', 'A lot', 'Passionately', 'Madly', 'Not at all']

//     console.log(phrase[(petals - 1) % phrase.length])
//     console.log(phrase[8])
//     //9: phrase[8]
// }

// flower(9)
